# Javascript Calculator
The Javascript Calculator is part of FreeCodeCamp's Advanced Front End Development Projects.
It is meant to fulfill the following user stories:
* Users can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
* Users can clear the input field with a clear button.
* Users can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

It currently does not meet all requirements and is not entirely functional, but it can be found [here](https://tspeed90.github.io/js-calculator).
